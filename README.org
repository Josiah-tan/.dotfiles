* Dotfiles
- contains dotfiles for moving in between different OS

#+begin_src bash
sudo apt install ripgrep fd-find ninja-build jq playerctl tmux xclip xsel
#+end_src
also need the following:
- gh
* installation:
- note that for some deeper submodules you are going to have to run git checkout main

git clone https://github.com/Josiah-tan/.dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
#+end_src
run ./install.zsh as repl
# git submodule update --init --recursive

* dumb things:

** wifi driver issues:
use second usb to download wifi files

** if Debian 10 PyQT5 doesn't work
discord → no Qt platform plugin 

** if plover never reconnects:
 sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER;

** dark theme:

firefox → add-ons and themes → dark

sudo apt install gnome-tweaks

gnome-tweaks

** if reconnect machine not working:

For linux reinstall plover_auto_reconnect_machine using Aerick's fork:2
